Welcome to Agros2D!

This manual is intended for Debian-based systems (for other systems it is very similar).

Requirements
============

First install the following free packages:
- Hermes2D (http://www.hpfem.org/hermes2d), '
- Nokia Qt 4.5 (http://www.qtsoftware.com/products), 
- Qwt 5.0 (http://qwt.sourceforge.net) and 
- Triangle (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html).

Install the following libraries:

$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools libsuitesparse-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev libtriangle-1.6

Hermes2D is not available in debian repositories yet and so you have to compile it from source. 
You can also do this through dpkg-buildpackage.

To compile Agros2D, you need qmake and g++:

$ sudo apt-get install qmake g++

Documentation
=============

Agros2D manual is available at runtime by pressing F1 and through the main menu. Help can be 
generated by running

qhelpgenerator ./doc/help/agros2d.qhp -o ./doc/help/agros2d.qch

or by using the following script:

$ ./agros2d.debian.sh -h

Localization
============

Agros2D is available in English and Czech. Localization files can be genarated as follows:

lrelease ./lang/*.ts ./lang/*.qm

or using the script

$ ./agros2d.debian.sh -l

Compilation
===========

The application can by compiled by running

$ qmake agros2d.pro
$ make

or using the script

$ ./agros2d.debian.sh -c

The binary package can be build as follows:

dpkg-buildpackage -sgpg -rfakeroot

or using the script

$ ./agros2d.debian.sh -p

Hints

To simplify the above steps (documentation generation, localization, and build) run:

$ ./agros2d.debian.sh -a
