Introduction
============

Agros2D is a multiplatform C++ application for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE) based on the Hermes2D_ library, developed by the group of Pavel Karban at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen. The user can create models, solve them using adaptive higher-order finite element methods (hp-FEM), and visualize and postprocess the results. Agros2D is distributed under the `GNU General Public License`_. Currently, the following problem types can be solved:

* Electrostatic fields
* Electric current fields
* Magnetostatic fields
* Harmonic magnetic fields
* Heat transfer
