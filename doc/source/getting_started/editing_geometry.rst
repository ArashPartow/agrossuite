Editing Geometry
================

Modes of Geometry Editing
-------------------------

When editing geometry is necessary to switch between the basic modes.

* Operate on nodes
* Operate on edges
* Operate on labels

To switch between different modes you can use the corresponding items in the menu "Problem" or key F5 (Operate on nodes), F6 (Operate on edges) and F7 (Operate on labels).

Adding and Editing Elements of Geometry
---------------------------------------

Adding nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nodes are basic elements for creating the geometry of the solved problem. You have several methods for adding their.

* Using coordinates enter

  Select "Add node..." in the menu "Problem" (submenu "Add"), or by pressing Alt+N and entering the nodes coordinates.

* Using mouse

  Move mouse to requested place and press left button together with Ctrl key.

* Using the two previous methods

  Move mouse to requested place and press Ctrl+Shift+N. Coordinates of the selected place is placed in a dialog for entering the nodes coordinates.

Adding edges
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add an edge you must have in the geometry of at least two nodes. You can add their to two methods.

* Using the coordinates of existing nodes

  Select "Add edge..." in the menu "Problem" (submenu "Add"), or by pressing Alt+E and selecting start and end nodes coordinates.

* Using mouse

  Move mouse to requested start node and press left button together with Ctrl key, then move the mouse to requested end node and also press left button together with Ctrl key.

Adding labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Labels are used to define areas. To add their you can use the same methods as for adding nodes.

Editing parametres of existing elements
---------------------------------------

You can press double click on the requested elements (nodes, edges, labels) for editing his parametres. For example, you can create an arc from the straight edge.

Tips
----

Some operations can also be found in the context menu, which can lead to press right button on the workspace, or on list "Problem".

You can use the full screen display mode to make the most of workspace views. To switch use key F11, or item in the context menu in workspace.
