TODO:

General
- handle errors during meshing
- check Czech translation
- prepare tutorials 
- find edges around selected area (inner edges has no marker)
- surface integrals on inner edges
- Maxwell tensor on edges (electric and magnetic field)

Magnetic field
- prepare gui and variables for permanent magnets (SLineEditValue - Brx and Bry)
- prepare gui and variables for velocity term (SLineEditValue - vx and vy)



ADD:
- modules:
    - magnetostatic
      - support for permanent magnets
      - support for velocity term
    - electric current field
    - field of elastic deformations

- rebase vector field drawing
- curvilinear element on arcs

QUESTIONS:
- real a cplx
